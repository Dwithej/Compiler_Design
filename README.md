Flex and Bison are tools often used together in the realm of compiler construction. They help in creating lexical analyzers (Flex, formerly known as Lex) 
and parsers (Bison, formerly known as Yacc) respectively.Flex and Bison provide a powerful framework for building compilers and interpreters for programmi
-ng languages. Flex handles the lexical analysis phase, breaking the input into tokens, while Bison handles the parsing phase, ensuring that the input conforms 
to the specified grammar rules.
